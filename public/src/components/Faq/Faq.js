        <h3>What is Twitter trend?</h3>
        <p>
          Twitter is a social platform where people from all over the world like
          to express their thoughts and opinions. Sometimes, these thoughts and
          opinions (topics) gain rapid attention and popularity in certain
          areas. For example, during popular events like- the olymic games,
          Oscars, etc, people tweet their thoughts about them on twitter. As
          soon as a topic stops gaining attention from the people, it is no
          longer considered as a trend on Twitter. Therefore, trends on twitter
          keep changing and since Twitter trends are realtime, it's not possible
          to view topics that were trending a few hours ago on Twitter website.

        <h3>Why can I not find data for my country or city at all?</h3>
        <p classname="faq-content">
          We completely <b>rely on Twitter</b> when retrieving and processing trends.
          We try to collect the data for as many locations as practically
          possible, but for some of them Twitter simply doesn't provide any
          information.
        </p>
        <h3>How do we determine the most tweeted hashtags?</h3>
        <p>
          We find out the <b>highest tweet volume</b> with the data provided by Twitter
          for every trend at all the times. It represents total number of tweets
          worldwide. We find out the highest number of tweets that Twitter
          provides for every trend every time we check. It represents total
          number of tweets worldwide over previous 24 hours.
